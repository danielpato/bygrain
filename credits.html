                    <b><a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/" target="_blank">98css</a> by Jdan</b> - 
                    This library was basically the foundation for this whole site and makes it absolutely beautiful. It's super customizable and fairly easy to add Javascript functionality

                    <b><a href="https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/" target="_blank">Windows 98 Icon Viewer</a> by Alex Meub</b> - 
                    This is where I got all of my icons (that weren't a part of the 98.css library). I'm so grateful I didn't have to dig through Google or anything for these

                    This Neocities site gave me so much inspiration, and it was so helpful to look at their site's code when I was getting stuck on minor things

                    <b><a href="https://iframe.chat/" target="_blank">Chattable</a> by Andrew</b> - 
                    An amazing (free and fully customizable!) live chat tool for any website. I built a custom theme to match my site based on the Windows XP theme. I was also the first person to point out the "received" class was misspelled in the 3 years that Chattable's been active!

                    <b><a href="https://arnesava.github.io/w95font/" target="_blank">W95</a> by Arne</b> - 
                    This is the font that is used for the "Scalable" option. I just can't seem to make it look good on its own, but I wanted to give people the option in case they want to zoom in/out.

                    <b><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1409109157690697774" target="_blank">Pixel Emojis Set</a> by Valentin</b> - 
                    A beautiful pixelated emoji set that I used for my chatbox. They remind me of the early Facebook chat emojis!

                    <b>Gifs/Pixel Art (multiple sources)</b> -
                    I pull my other assets from various sites (with permission). Each asset is linked to the parent site, if not the exact page.
